# Welcome to Julien's Corner!

Hi &#128075;, you've found Julien Chaffraix's personal page.

I work for Slack within a small team that packages the [HipHop Virtual Machine](https://hhvm.com/) and adapts it to meet our engineering's needs.

In the past, I have worked on Chrome at Google (and several other companies), improving the HTML &amp; CSS rendering.

You can find more details on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jchaffraix"><img class="icon" src="/style/icons/linkedin.svg" alt="Linkedin icon"></img></a>.
