## Financial independence

**Radical Personal Finance** [website](https://radicalpersonalfinance.libsyn.com/)

This is a show about personal finance, but it does have a good emphasis on financial independence. Very lengthy podcast (episodes are 1h min) but very knowledgeable host that is willing to follow pretty unique avenues (e.g. survivalism as financial planning).

Some of the shows are pretty unique, those 2 stood up for me:

1. Episode 33: What Can We Learn About Finance from Dumpster Divers, Freegans, Vagabonds and Hobos?
2. Episode 754: How to Invest in Commodities in a Radical Way (Metals, Tools, Food, Alcohol, etc.)

**MadFientist** [website](https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/)

Very solid podcast on financial independence using stocks. Slowed down a couple of years ago as the host hit financial independence so look for older episodes.

## Productivity

**Tim Ferris Show** [website](https://tim.blog/podcast/)

Tim Ferris is the reference on productivity so it's hard not to mention it. Yet I will give a half-recommendation on this one: Tim Ferris has built his image through very focused self-promotion. Some of it I would consider shady (e.g. [his winning a world championship due to a technicality, not skills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelschein/2019/01/17/tim-ferriss-is-everything-thats-wrong-with-the-modern-world-and-why-you-should-follow-his-lead/?sh=184b63e73f3d)). 

So beware the half-truth and the sometimes shady advertising in the podcast/mailing list.

It is a good resource nevertheless if you keep your critical thinking on high alert.

## Software

**O11cast ("ollycast")** [website](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast) [rss feed](https://www.heavybit.com/category/library/podcasts/o11ycast/feed/feed.rss)

Podcast about observability in distributed systems.

**The Rework podcast** [website](https://37signals.com/podcast/)

Music from the founders of an old independent software vendor (37signals). I like their contrarian thinking (stay small, no external capital, ...).

**Land of the giant** [website](https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast)

This podcast dedicates a full season to one of the Giants in the industry (Google, Apple, Facebook/Meta...). The podcast is a great way to get to know those giants, both in terms of their origin but also some of their lesser known controversies.

**Decoder** [website](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/decoder-with-nilay-patel)

Decoder helps you decode the tech news cycle so the current podcasts are the most relevant. Nilay Patel is a good host that does ask some hard questions.

**IdealCast** [website](https://itrevolution.com/podcast/)

A defunct podcast about DevOps. Very in-depth and interesting.

## General knowledge

**The knowledge project** [website](https://fs.blog/episodes/)

A podcast that dives into different topics with the goal of making you a more rounded person.

**Naval** [website](https://nav.al/)

The old episodes are very short musing about random topics, like life, business, ... Pretty insightful and bite-sized.

<hr />

## Business

**Indie Hacker** [website](https://www.indiehackers.com/)

Discussions about building businesses as an independent. A lot of software businesses but it is not limited to the field.

If you're considering a soloentrepreneur path, highly recommend the 2 parts interview with Pieter Levels:

1. [Episode 241 - Part 1](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/241-pieter-levels)
2. [Episode 242 - Part 2](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/242-pieter-levels)

**Think like an owner** [website](https://tlaopodcast.com/)

This is a solid podcast about ownership/operation of small businesses.

## Humor

I include podcasts that make me laugh, hopefully you find some joy in them too &#x1F601 

**If books could kill** [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Books_Could_Kill)

This shows looks at popular books and dissects them. This podcast merits to be listened to as it is both funny and insightful, usually unearthing some fallacies in the author's arguments.

**5-4** [website](https://shows.acast.com/fivefourpod)

A legal commentary on some bad US supreme court decisions. Both funny, insightful and depressing at times.

**Conan O'Brien needs a friend** [website](https://teamcoco.com/podcasts/conan-obrien-needs-a-friend)

Improv' style with a different guest each time.

I recommend:
* Episode 242 - Patton Oswalt Returns (the part about AI is amazing, starting 19:00)
