            You can easily lose money when investing. In fact, there is a large swath of the financial sector that profits from people making mistakes.<br/>
            The worst you can do is act recklessly and lose money (looking at you, HODL gang).

          This diagram is (obviously) highly simplified but outlines the basic math of FI. This is pretty powerful as you know the 2 levers to manipulate to get to it.<br/>
          Also once you’re on a path, you can compute it.

          The 2 levers of FI:
          <ul>
            <li>Increase <span class="cashflow">cash flow</span><br/></li>
            <li>Decrease <span class="expenses">expenses</span></li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
          <ul>
            <li>Increase cash flow: increase how much you stash (saving rate, see below) or the quality of your investment (returns)</li>
            <li>Decrease your expenses</li>
          </ul>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          Increase <span class="cashflow">cash flow</span><br/>
          <h1>Decrease <span class="expenses">expenses</span><h1>

          $1 <span class="expense">expense</span> = $25 of capital for <span class="cashflow">cash flow</span>
          <aside class="notes">
            Using the 4% rule.<br/>
            If you get better returns, the amount of capital will be lower. However I don’t know of any investments returning 100% per year forever so the multiplier is always > 1x.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          $1 of capital for <span class="cashflow">cash flow</span> = $1.5 - $2 in income
          <aside class="notes">
            That’s to account for taxes.<br/>
            For high-income earners (which I hope is most folks reading this), it’s closer to $2. $2 is a good rule of thumb.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          $1 <span class="expenses">expense</span> = $38 - $50 in income
          <aside class="notes">This is the capital T Truth about expenses. The returns are pretty low with a diversified portfolio so your expenses do matter.</aside>

          \[\begin{aligned}
          saving\_rate &amp; = \frac{income - expenses}{income}

          <aside class="notes">
            Very powerful concept: the saving rate is how much you’re stashing away.<br/>
            The closer you get to 100% the faster you will reach FI (exponentially so).

            Note that the relationship is not linear. The closer you get to 100% the faster it goes.<br/>
            That's the power of a high saving rate!
