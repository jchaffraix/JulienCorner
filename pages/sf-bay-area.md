# What to do in the San Francisco / Bay Area

# General

## Alcohol

**tl;dr: Always carry an ID if you intent to drink alcohol**.

California has some stringent alcohol laws, which means that bars/restaurants enforce them (they can lose their license). The big one is that only people above 21 years-old can drink alcohol so be ready to show an ID when entering a bar or ordering alcohol.

Another law is that you can't take the alcohol out of a bar/restaurant (they usually indicate when you're not allowed to bring it)

On beaches/parks, it's going to be on a case-by-case basis. The park's website will list any restrictions. Glass is usually not allowed on the beach as broken glass is dangerous. Even when alcohol is not allowed, you may still be able to do it if you're respectful of other folks (check what the locals do if you can!). I have heard about folks getting a ticket for this, but only every got a warning for the only time I forgot about those rules and got checked.

## Weather

Most of California is part of a desert (mojave or sonoran depending on where you are). This means that you should expect large daily variation of temperature inland. It is very common to get temperature of 40 C and above (100-100 F) during summer. So plan for hot.

The Californian coast is slightly better due to a cold artic stream that cools it down. This stream has 2 consequences:

1. Most people don't go swimming at the beach. This is because the water is cold throughout the year. Be careful with hypothermia if you do.
2. It gets windy due to the temperature difference between the hot Central Valley and the cool ocean.
3. At night even in summer, it can get cold (!!!).

Of interest, SF is enclosed by water and thus has a micro-climate. It is significantly cooler than the peninsula south of it. Also summers are usually cloudy and evenings cold (something that surprises most folks).

# &#x1F496; Must do

## San Francisco

I strongly recommend visiting the [Alcatraz Island](https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm). They did a good job making it engaging. Plus there is a great view of San Francisco downtown. You can only get to the island by a ferry so the tickets tend to book fast. I recommend **booking at least 3-4 weeks before visiting**. Reserve at least a half-day for Alcatraz.

In San Francisco downtown, those are the points I would recommend checking:
- Chinatown's Dragon Gate (@ 413-401 Grant Ave). You can also visit Chinatown while at it (and get some good Chinese food too).
- Take the [cable cart](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/cable-cars) from the Market stop to the Fisherman's Wharf stop. Those are pretty unique to San Francisco and give you a good experience of the hilly city. I recommend standing on the side of the cart so you get a full experience. Expect 30-60 mins wait before boarding as those are popular.
- The painted ladies (@ Alamo Square) are some well-preserved Victorian houses (and a picture's favorite).
- Lombard Street (enter through 1099 Lombard Street) is a great to drive through. It is a uniquely crooked street that oversees the bay. Make sure to stop after and walk it.
- The Mission District (see below).
- The Castro. This is the gay district in San Francisco and has a special atmosphere.

### Golden Gate

The Golden Gate Bridge is also an iconic San Francisco monument and is definitely a must.

It is a bit off center compared to the downtown area so you will need some mode of transportation to get there (public transport is not great in that area).

You can also walk/bike the length of the bridge (but I have never done it so no tips on this).

If you take a car across the bridge, you have a good vista point right after the Golden Gate on the right: there you can get good pictures of the bridge and the city. You can continue from there the quaint town of Sausalito (about 10-15 mins drive from the vista point). The town is a bit touristy but it's a good place for some souvenir and some food/drinks close to the water. The city consists mainly of a single street with most of the shops along it. If you're willing to go uphill, there are some free parking.

Note: The bridge is free going North but you have a toll going South.

### Mission District

You can stop at the BART stop "16th St Mission".

This is a popular district with some really good authentic Mexican food. You check any of the taqueria there.

There are some interesting places to visit in the district:
- The Mission Dolores park. A San Francisco spot for folks to go chill and do people watching. If you're in a rush, feel free to skip: it's a place to spend a few hours to get the atmosphere, especially on a week-end.
- The Pirate Supply Store (@ 826 Valencia St). A pretty unique store that sells pirate-themed trinklets to fund the writing center next to it.
- Urban Putt (@ 1096 S Van Ness Ave). This is an indoor mini-golf, except that it is also a bar so great to do at night.

## Silicon Valley

### Mountain View

Google has its headquarters in Mountain View. While the campus is private, it is unofficially open to visitors. You can park close to the original building at 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway. You can then walk the main campus (Building 40, 41, 42, 43) to enjoy the T-Rex "Stan" and the campus vibe.

If you know someone there, you can get to enjoy some really good cookings (Charlies is a good default caf√© there). Also make sure to visit the Visitor Center with your escort.

If you don't have an escort, please DO NOT TRY TO ENTER ANY OF THE BUILDINGS. Not only is this rude, but it is also going to get you escorted out of the campus.

# Walking

I like walking around the city as you get to experience it more closely. Beware that some of those loops may be pretty long (and include some steep hike).

## Downtown SF

A good loop is to drop the car on the Embarcadero.<br>
Walk to the Ferry Building and check out the inside.<br>
Walk to Union Square by following Market St.<br>
Walk to Chinatown's Dragon Gate and get lost in Chinatown.<br>
Get back to Market to take the Cable Cart all the way to Fisherman's Wharf.<br>
Visit Fisherman's Wharf (there are some harbor seals most of the years, behind the buildings east of the pier)<br>
Walk the Embarcadero south to your car.

You can optionally stop by Levi's Plaza when walking south on the Embarcadero. Levi's Plaza hosts the headquarters of Levi, which also include a store. I recommend continuing past Levi's Plaza to take Filbert's steps (@ 202 Filbert St): those are city gardens' along the stairs that will get you all the way to Coit Tower. I don't recommend Coit Tower (it's expensive and not really worth it) but the view there is nice and free.

# Drinking

Note: I am not much of a foodie so no recommendations for restaurants.

## San Francisco

I recommend Local Edition (@ 691 Market St). It is a [speak-easy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakeasy) that is known for its cocktails and live music (mostly Jazz). A bit pricy but a unique experience.


## East Bay

A good place to get some drinks is [Spirits Alley](https://www.alamedaca.gov/RESIDENTS/Visiting-Alameda/Attractions-in-Alameda/Spirits-Alley) in Alameda. Spirits Alley is part of the old military base so a lot of the options are in the old plane hangars. This includes wineries, breweries and distilleries close by so you get to choose your "poison" &#x1F37B; &#x1F942;

My favorite place there is Faction Brewing (@ 2501 Monarch St). The beers are good, the place is large (with a nice outdoor area) and you get a great view of San Francisco.

## Silicon Valley

Single Barrel (San Jose downtown) is another [speak-easy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakeasy). The place is known for its cocktails that are crafted based on your tastes by a team of mixologists. Busy on weekends so you may have to wait outside 30+ mins.

San Pedro Square is a popular place with a lot of options for booze. Music on weekends.
