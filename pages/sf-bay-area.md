# What to do in the San Francisco / Bay Area

# &#x1F496; Must do

## San Francisco

I strongly recommend visiting the [Alcatraz Island](https://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm). They did a good job making it engaging. Plus there is a great view of San Francisco downtown. You can only get to the island by a ferry so the tickets tend to book fast. I recommend **booking at least 3-4 weeks before visiting**. Reserve about at least a half-day for this.

In San Francisco, those are the points I would recommend checking:
- Chinatown's Dragon Gate (@ 413-401 Grant Ave). You can also visit Chinatown while at it (and get some good Chinese food too).
- Take the [cable cart](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/cable-cars) from the Market stop to the Fisherman's Wharf stop. Those are pretty unique to San Francisco and give you a good experience of the hilly city. I recommend standing on the side of the cart so you get a full experience. Expect 30-60 mins wait before boarding as those are popular.
- The painted ladies (@ Alamo Square) are some well-preserved Victorian houses (and a picture's favorite).
- Lombard Street (enter through 1099 Lombard Street) is a great to drive through. It is a uniquely crooked street that oversees the bay. Make sure to stop after and walk it.
- The Mission District (see below).
- The Castro. This is the gay district in San Francisco and has a very special atmosphere.

### Mission District

You can stop at the BART stop "16th St Mission".

This is a popular district with some really good authentic Mexican food. You check any of the taqueria there.

There are some interesting places to visit in the district:
- The Mission Dolores park. A San Francisco spot for folks to go chill and do people watching. If you're in a rush, feel free to skip: it's a place to spend a few hours to get the atmosphere, especially on a week-end.
- The Pirate Supply Store (@ 826 Valencia St). A pretty unique store that sells pirate-themed trinklets to fund the writing center next to it.
- Urban Putt (@ 1096 S Van Ness Ave). This is an indoor mini-golf, except that it is also a bar so great to do at night.

## Silicon Valley

### Mountain View

Google has its headquarters in Mountain View. While the campus is private, it is unofficially open to visitors. You can park close to the original building at 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway. You can then walk the main campus (Building 40, 41, 42, 43) to enjoy the T-Rex "Stan" and the campus vibe.

If you know someone there, you can get to enjoy some really good cookings (Charlies is a good default cafe there). Also make sure to visit the Visitor Center with your escort.

If you don't have an escort, please DO NOT TRY TO ENTER ANY OF THE BUILDINGS. Not only is this rude, but it is also going to get you escorted out of the campus.

# Walking

I like walking around the city as you get to experience it more closely. Beware that some of those loops may be pretty long (and include some steep hike).

## Downtown SF

A good loop is to drop the car on the Embarcadero.
Walk to the Ferry Building and check out the inside.
Walk to Union Square by following Market St.
Walk to Chinatown's Dragon Gate and get lost in Chinatown.
Get back to Market to take the Cable Cart all the way to Fisherman's Wharf.
Visit Fisherman's Wharf (there are some harbor seals most of the years, behind the buildings east of the pier)
Walk the Embarcadero south.

You can optionally stop by Levi's Plaza to see the headquarters of Levi, which includes a store too. I recommend continuing past Levi's Plaza to take Filbert's steps (@ 202 Filbert St): those are city gardens' along steps that will get you all the way to Coit Tower. I don't recommend Coit Tower but the view there is nice.

# Drinking

Note: I am not much of a foodie so no recommendations for restaurants.

**Warning: Always carry your ID when visiting any bars**.
Due to the stringent alcohol laws, it is common for establishments to ask EVERYONE to show a valid ID before letting them in.

## San Francisco

I recommend Local Edition (@ 691 Market St). It is a [speak-easy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakeasy) that is known for its cocktails and live music (mostly Jazz). A bit pricy but a unique experience.


## East Bay

A good place to get some drinks is [Spirits Alley](https://www.alamedaca.gov/RESIDENTS/Visiting-Alameda/Attractions-in-Alameda/Spirits-Alley) in Alameda. Spirits Alley is part of the old military based so a lot of the options are in old plane hangars. Lots of options there including wineries, breweries and distilleries in close proximity so you get to choose your "poison" &#x1F37B; &#x1F942;

My favorite place there is Faction Brewing (@ 2501 Monarch St). The beers are good, the place is large (with a nice outdoor area) and you get a great view of San Francisco.

## Silicon Valley

Single Barrel (San Jose downtown) is another [speak-easy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakeasy). The place is known for its cocktails that are crafted based on your tastes by a team of mixologists. Busy on weekends so you may have to wait outside 30+ mins.

San Pedro Square is a popular place with a lot of options for booze. Music on weekends.
