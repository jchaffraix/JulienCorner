# Books

I have been reading about 30-50 books a year for several years now. Most of the books I read are forgotten but a few stick and have an impact in how I approach problems. This the list.

I have expanded it a bit to include a few blogs/videos when it made sense.

Note: This is a highly personal list. The books listed are a good start on a particular topic... but when it comes to reading, **reading wide** is more important than sticking to classics.


## Financial independence

**Your money or your life: 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence** [website](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book/)

This is an old classic from before we had the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement. The investments are outdated but the plan and psychology parts are still solid.

**Early Retirement Extreme** [website](https://earlyretirementextreme.com/)

This is one of the cornerstone book in the FIRE movement. A book about applying [General System Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) to life. Very insightful albeit dry.

**Mister Money Moustache**

[Amazing blog about FIRE](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) with a no-nonsense writing style and very insightful.

Highly recommend reading the following articles:

** [Getting Rich: from Zero to Hero in One Blog Post](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/)
** [The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)


# Investing

**Rich dad/poor dad**

Very inspirational book that launched many investors. The story is probably fake but it will make you want to invest and rethink how you use your money.

**What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow... And 36 Other Key Financial Measures**

A solid introduction book about all the metrics useful for investing in real estate, with some explanations about their limitations and examples to understand the concepts. While framed as a real estate book, the metrics do apply to other investment too (e.g. business).

## Productivity

**Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware**

This is a great book on learning and thinking with a focus on software engineers. Opened my eyes on some techniques to help with both (mindmap and the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition FTW!).

**4 hour work-week**

A book that introduced lifestyle design. The book itself may be a bit gimmicky at times, but there is some wisdom if you can get past this.

**The first 90 days**

A great book on starting a new job/position that was suggested by one of my manager. It is very focused on getting quick impact while helping you grow into your position.

**Eat this frog by Brian Tracy**

A book about goals! A "frog" is a hard task and the tongue-in-cheek book outline how to eat this frog :-)

**Atomic habits**

A great book on habits (forming, breaking). Fairly short and to the point.

Note: Some folks really like **The power of habits** that looks into habits too but didn't really do anything for me (but may help you!).

## Simplifying

Note: I struggle with simplifying in general, which is why it has its own category.

**Essentialism**

A short book on simplifying and focusing on doing less.

**The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results**

Another book on simplifying, using the question: "What is the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

**The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing**

Very practical book on decluttering if you can get past some of the author's idiosyncracies, like thanking her stuff before discarding them.

## Software engineering

**The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact**

I have not read this book but it is high on my list. I highly recommend the [Talk at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIz7H5ruy0) about the book that is very insightful.

**The DevOps handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations**

A very solid introduction into DevOps. It is a bit hard to read but it opens my eyes on the power of agile applied to ops.

## Misc

**How to read a book**
A book about... reading. This is super meta but this is a must read if you intent to read a lot as it is super helpful to increase retention and contextualize the reading. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

**Anything you want**

Derek Sivers is an interesting character and it shows in this short book. A lot of counter-

**The art of possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life**

A very odd book. Very inspirational and touching.

**Just mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption**

A tough book on the prison system in the USA and how bad the situation is. Both revolting and inspirational.
