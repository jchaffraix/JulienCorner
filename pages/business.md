# Notes on business

## How to select an area to start in?

Start with some INTROSPECTION:

1. Decide on what makes **you** happy (see the [helpful questions section below](#helpful_questions))
2. Decide on what the company/you will stand for

Some common themes for 2. are: authenticity, quality, customer's experience.

Finding a niche may be useful but it is not a pre-requisite.

Talk to customers to make sure you're solving an actual problem: we want a painkiller, not vitamins.

For better profits, go for a dull, boring business with logistical challenges and where software is an _enabler_, not core. In general, slow growth, high retention is better than high growth, high churn.

## How to get started?

Prepare thoroughly.

**BUT:**

* it's better to have a crappy product with customers rather than a perfect product without any.
* Avoid analysis paralysis
* Want to go for _continual_ learning.

[Ready, Fire, Aim]

Start with SALES or marketing --> "sell first, build later" (prototype & test)

Marketing aims to reach thousands of customers **vs** sales aims to reach a few (thus sales is easier)

_Tip_: On a 2-3 months project, spend 2 months booking jobs then 1 month building the ops to clear the backlog.

&#9888; Starting is **hard**, KEEP GOING and be patient. Starting a business takes 5-7 years.

## How to sustain the business?

* Focus --> want to build a flywheel
* Track some KPIs _weekly_. Examples of KPIS:
  * free cash flow (MUST KPI as want to start in the game)
  * customer retention/churn/count
  * return on capital
  * time invested into each product/service
* Focus on the long-term (5-10 years time horizon, at least)
* Be a partner, be of service, be helpful (rather than being shiny) --> understand your customers (their business, what is essential to them?, ...)
* Stay scrappy
Write down your PROCESSES. Eventually automate them, but it's not required.

### Helpful quotes

> You can't improve your process if nothing is written down. While it may seem daunting to get started, eventually incremental progress each day towards documenting and tracking your business matters. Tracking metrics brings awareness to you and your team. Similar to incentives, the very fact that you highlight those metrics means that they are important

> Customers are hiring companies not just for the price but the expertise, peace of mind, professionalism, ease to work with, and a host of other completely intangible things (like presentation, brand, ...). The price is effectively set to the lowers of those criteria. [...] This is what luxury brands get right and that's why people pay a premium for it

> To create something meaningful, you can't outsource the work, even to a blue-chip name-brand company. Yes, it may be easier to hire a consultant but value comes from getting involved, forming an opinion, and doing the creative work yourself. Yes, it's much harder that way. It takes more time and it might cost you more money in the end. But if you constantly outsource and benchmark you cannot create something special
